Meta-analyses in psychology often pool outcomes measured using different instruments, with many studies reporting only a subset of these outcomes. 
Such instruments typically measure the same underlying construct and are statistically correlated, making multivariate meta-analysis a methodologically appropriate choice. 
However, missing outcomes raise concerns about bias and inference validity, particularly when the mechanism driving missingness is unknown. 
While some outcomes may be Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) or Missing at Random (MAR), a more complex scenario arises when outcomes are Missing Not At Random (MNAR), 
that is, when the probability of non-reporting depends on the unobserved values themselves.

We explore outcome-level missingness in multivariate meta-analysis through a series of simulation studies and an application to real psychological data. 
A range of imputation strategies is evaluated under MCAR, MAR, and MNAR assumptions, including uniform, univariate, multivariate, and truncated normal imputations with variance inflation.
To account for uncertainty about the true missingness mechanism, we adopt a multiverse framework for sensitivity analysis, varying assumptions and model specifications to assess 
the robustness of the results.

This approach offers several strengths. It preserves the correlation structure across outcomes, avoiding artificial inflation or deflation of heterogeneity. 
It flexibly accommodates various missingness scenarios without relying on computationally intensive methods such as MCMC. 
It supports transparent inference by explicitly mapping how conclusions vary under different assumptions. 
Finally, it is easily implementable with standard software and provides fast results.

Our findings show that assuming MAR when the data may be MNAR can lead to biased estimates and undercoverage. 
In contrast, structurally coherent and flexible imputation strategies that incorporate joint distributions and sensitivity parameters improve inferential validity. 
We conclude with practical recommendations and code for conducting multiverse sensitivity analysis in psychological meta-analysis when outcome-level missingness is present and 
the missingness mechanism is uncertain.
